i dont know what files are needed besides main.*
if you're looking to compile it, just use makecode at
https://makecode.microbit.org/
or use the provided compiled version (should be same code)
i do not have a physical microbit to play around with so
i cannot test any bugs regarding hardware (not emu).

for compiled versions, it will be in the form of
[projname]-compiled-[releasenum].hex
so if projname = foo and it is the first release, it will be
foo-compiled-1.hex

i am not responsible for anything that may happen and i agree to:
- not fix anything for you
- not accept any changes, it's my bad code
- close your issue if it regards my code - it worked for me, cry about it.
- not add documentation so others can use it
  - i can figure it out, you dont need to.
- eat your mcnuggies if you whine about all of this.
